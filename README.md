<b>Gaussian sampling over integers.</b> Knuth-Yao constant-time implementation.</br>
<b>Basis orthogonalization.</b> Usual Gram-Schmidt procedure.</br>
<b>Gaussian sampling over lattices.</b> Usual Gaussian sampler, which is quite similiar to Klein's, Klein's and Peikert's methods, and compact sampler of (Lyubashevsky and Prest, 2015). </br>
